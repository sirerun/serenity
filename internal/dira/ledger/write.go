// maxAllocationAttempts bounds the id search so a pathological ledger or a
// misbehaving backend fails with an explanation rather than spinning. Every
// attempt past the first means a concurrent writer took the candidate id, so the
// bound is really a concurrency bound: it tolerates four thousand writers racing
// for the same kind at the same instant, against the 32 the design has to
// survive. A ledger will hit int-0002's latency budget long before it hits this.

// Add writes e as a new entry, giving it the lowest unused id for its kind.
//
// Id allocation is a shared-counter problem with unattended concurrent writers —
// `dira log` runs from Stop hooks in parallel sessions on one repository — and
// the naive form of it is a silent data-loss bug: scan for the highest id, add
// one, write, and two sessions that scanned at the same moment produce one entry
// where there should be two. Nothing reports it, because a write that overwrote
// something looks exactly like a write.
//
// So allocation is not a scan. The scan only proposes; Store.Create disposes.
// Create is exclusive (dec-0005 put it in the interface for this: O_EXCL on the
// local backend, a sha-less PUT on the GitHub Contents API), so a losing racer
// gets ErrExists instead of clobbering the winner, learns that the id is taken,
// and moves to the next candidate. Every candidate has exactly one winner, so N
// racers take N distinct ids after at most N-1 collisions each. There is no lock
// anywhere in this, which is what lets the same allocator work over a backend
// where no lock exists.
//
// The one List is a starting point rather than a source of truth. It is what
// makes the common case one round trip; correctness comes from Create alone, and
// a stale list costs a retry rather than an entry.
//
// On success e.ID holds the allocated id. On failure e.ID is left empty, because
// an entry carrying an id that was never written is a lie a caller would report.
