// Package frontmatter splits a dira entry file into its YAML frontmatter and
// its markdown body.
//
// It is a separate package for one reason, and the reason is a measurement.
// Splitting a file on `---` is string handling and costs nothing; the schema
// package next door embeds entry.schema.json and compiles it with
// santhosh-tekuri/jsonschema. When the ledger codec reached into schema for
// this one function, the validator came with it: linking jsonschema into the
// binary costs milliseconds of package init and ~21,700 allocations on every
// dira invocation, warm or cold, whether or not anything validates. int-0002
// budgets a hook invocation at well under 100ms, and a hook fires on every tool
// call, so that is a real share of the budget spent on a library the command
// path never calls.
//
// So the split lives here, where it depends on nothing, and schema forwards to
// it. schema.SplitFrontmatter and schema.ErrNoFrontmatter remain the published
// names — this is a dependency move, not an API change — but a package on the
// command path should import this one.

// ErrMissing marks a file that is not an entry at all, as opposed to an entry
// that is wrong. The distinction matters: the first is a stray file, the second
// is ledger rot, and only the second should fail a ledger-wide gate.
//
// It is the value schema.ErrNoFrontmatter names, so errors.Is answers the same
// either way and no caller has to know which package it came from.
